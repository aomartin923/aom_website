My first graph shows the total number of mountain yellow-legged frogs each year across all water bodies. My second graph shows a column graph containing total counts of adult and sub-adult frogs observed in the top 5 lakes with the most counts.\n\n\nhide\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE )\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n# Read in the amphibians data\namphibians <- read_csv(here('data','sierra_amphibians.csv'))%>% clean_names()\n\n\n\nPart 1: Total Rana Muscosa Count by Year and Life Stage\n\n\nhide\n\n#filter to only include rana muscosa and remove egg mass \nrana_muscosa <- amphibians %>% \n  filter(amphibian_species == \"RAMU\", amphibian_life_stage != \"EggMass\") %>% \n  #change the date\n  mutate(survey_date = mdy(survey_date)) %>% \n  #add new column year\n  mutate(year = year(survey_date))\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n#plot the graph \nrana_muscosa %>% \n  group_by(year, amphibian_life_stage) %>% #group by year and life stage\n  summarize(amphibian_count = n()) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = amphibian_count)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(fill = amphibian_life_stage), stat = \"identity\") +\n    labs(x = \"Year\",\n         y = \" Total Frog Count by Life Stage\", fill = \"Life Stage\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Number of frogs (rana muscosa) within each life stage from 1995-2002\")\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Total Sub-Adult and Adult Rana Muscosa Frogs\n\n\nhide\n\n#reformat lake id \nrana_muscosa$lake_id <-sub(\"^\",\"Lake \",rana_muscosa$lake_id)\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n#Wrangle the data a bit\ntotal_adult_amphibians <- rana_muscosa %>% \n  filter(amphibian_life_stage !=\"Tadpole\") %>% \ngroup_by (lake_id) %>% \n  summarize(total_adult_amphibians = sum(amphibian_number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \nslice_max(total_adult_amphibians, n = 5)\n\n\n\n\n\nhide\n\n# Plot the graph\ntotal_adult_amphibians %>% \nmutate(lake_id = fct_reorder(lake_id, total_adult_amphibians)) %>% \nggplot ( aes (x =total_adult_amphibians, \n            y = lake_id, label = total_adult_amphibians)) +\n  geom_col(na.rm = FALSE, color = \"khaki4\", fill= \"gold2\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  labs( x = \"Total Adult Frogs per Site\", y = \"Lake Site\" , title = \"Total Adult Mountain Yellow-Legged Frogs in 5 Lakes\")\n\n\n\n\nData Citation: Knapp, R.A., C.

We decided to focus on three salmon species (Steelhead, Jack Coho, and Coho) to analyze time series patterns. We first explored the pattern of the passages for each observed species using an original time series, next we created a season plot to explore any seasonality within each species’ passages, and finally we included the total annual passage counts for each salmon species observed.\nData Source: Columbia River DART (Data Access in Real Time), 2010.
